Earlier, voices on the internet were unique. Apart from those who write for a living and _know_ how to write, most people aren’t extremely articulate, and so different corners of the internet used to have different voices. I could hear them— the overly optimistic corporate-sounding American ones and others which _almost_ sounded like them but not quite. The style deviating more the farther you move from North America, I theorize.

I used to love reading these different voices. I especially loved those trying to mimic the soulless corpo tone while still carying their locale's tinge. It was precisely the uncanny valley-ness of them that made it a kind of mental exercise for me to determine what specific change in word choice or order would take the given text from suboptimal to perfectly natural.

With the advent of AI text generation, the Internet's voices have, sadly, faded away. I no longer encounter the typical Indian English word choices—just enough off grammatically so as to not ring any major bells. Nor do I see the distinctively South Asian word choices anymore. It has all now been _gentrified_—a shallow copy of a shallow copy. 

This realization hit when I opened Coursera to do an assignment. Where you’d usually find the instructor’s specific guidelines, there was now a sea of AI-generated fluff, loudly proclaiming nothing. It probably isn't just me, but after being exposed to so much non-AI text in the past and mountains of AI garbage recently, I’ve developed an intuition for detecting AI-generated text. Phrases like "boost your xyz to success" or "kickstart your journey to yz" make my brain immediately switch off. The Lack of Original Thought, Human Effort, and/or Creativity causes my brain to feel negatively stimulated and my interest vanishes just as quickly. Rant over.
